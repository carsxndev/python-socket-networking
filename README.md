# Python HTTP Traffic Simulator /murrezsec x carsxn

This repository contains a Python-based networking laboratory designed for educational and research purposes.  
The project demonstrates how HTTP requests can be generated and managed using sockets, proxies, and multi-threading.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to provide a controlled environment for studying HTTP client behavior, request headers, proxy usage, and concurrent network connections.

The code is intended to support learning in the following areas:
- Python socket programming
- HTTP request structure
- Proxy-based networking
- Multi-threaded request handling

## Intended Use

This software is intended solely for:
- Educational study
- Academic research
- Testing in environments where the user has explicit authorization

Any use of this software against systems without permission is strictly prohibited.

## Disclaimer

This project is provided "as is" without any warranty.  
The author assumes no responsibility for misuse, damage, or legal consequences resulting from improper use of this software.

## Features

- HTTP request generation using raw sockets
- Configurable request headers and user-agent strings
- Proxy-based connection handling (SOCKS4 / SOCKS5)
- Multi-threaded execution model
- Traffic pattern experimentation modes

## Requirements

- Python 3.14
- requests
- PySocks

## Execution

Run the script using Python and follow the interactive prompts:


```bash
python3 main.py
